# click_to_move_files
python program to move files from one folder to another, sorted. Good for decluttering desktop?

3 main things to change in the code
1) Source. Change source to the path you want files moved out of
2) Dest. Change dest to the path you want files moved and sorted into
3) extensions. python dictionary that uses file extensions('.pdf', '.doc') as keys the get new destination.

keeps desktops or other places looking nice.
